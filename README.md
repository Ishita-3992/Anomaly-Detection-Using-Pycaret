### Anomaly Detection using PyCaret

#### Overview

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying unusual patterns or observations in a dataset that deviate significantly from normal behavior. This project leverages PyCaret to efficiently implement anomaly detection using multiple models such as Isolation Forest (iforest), Minimum Covariance Determinant (mcd), Support Vector Machine (svm), Clustering models, and more.

#### Key Features

1. Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Normalizing features

Preparing the dataset for modeling

2. Modeling

Implementation of various anomaly detection algorithms:

Isolation Forest (iforest)

One-Class SVM (svm)

Minimum Covariance Determinant (mcd)

Clustering-based approaches (KMeans, DBSCAN, etc.)

3. Evaluation

Detailed analysis of model performance using:

Silhouette Score for clustering models

Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for classification-based methods

Visualizations such as scatter plots, decision boundaries, and anomaly heatmaps

#### Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install pycaret scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

#### Additional Libraries Used:

sklearn.cluster (for clustering-based anomaly detection)

sklearn.metrics (for evaluation)

KMeans (for cluster-based modeling)

#### Results and Insights

A detailed report showcases how the Silhouette Score varies with respect to the number of clusters for different models.

Comparative performance analysis of different anomaly detection techniques.

Recommendations on selecting the best model based on dataset characteristics.

#### Conclusion

This project demonstrates an efficient way to detect anomalies using PyCaret and various machine learning techniques. The comparative study of multiple models helps in selecting the most effective approach for different datasets.
