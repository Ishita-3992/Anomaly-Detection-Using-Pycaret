Anomaly detection is a process of identifying unusual patterns or observations in a dataset
that deviate significantly from the normal behaviour. 

Using PyCaret, I have  implemented anomaly detection efficiently by testing the same dataset on different models
like iforest,mcd,svm,cluster and more

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and preparing the dataset.

Modeling: Implementation of anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, or statistical methods).

Evaluation: Detailed analysis of the model's performance using metrics and visualizations.

Requirements

Python 
Libraries: pycaret,sklearn.cluster, KMeans, sklearn.metrics

Conclusion:
A detailed report shows how the Silhouette Score is changing with respect to number of clusters for each model
